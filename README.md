# RuStan: The Rust Interface to Stan

**RuStan** will (at some point in the future) provide a
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) interface to
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), a package for Bayesian inference using
the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

Like the paragraph above, initial development is leaning heavily on
[pystan](https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan).
